## Cannes 2026 Deployment And Demo

### Deployment Shape

#### Local deterministic mode

- broker, planner, scorer, and web app run locally
- Arc contract interactions mocked or pointed to local chain
- World and 0G have local or stubbed fallback modes

Purpose:
- guaranteed demo backup

#### Public testnet rehearsal

- escrow contract deployed to a public rehearsal network
- broker and web app pointed at rehearsal endpoints
- World and 0G integrations tested with the same seeded accounts used for final demo where possible

Purpose:
- validate end-to-end deploy before public demo

#### Public demo mode

- web app deployed publicly
- broker, planner, scorer, and dossier writer on hosted backend
- escrow contract deployed on Arc public network after rehearsal pass
- sponsor integrations wired to real services where stable enough

Purpose:
- prize eligibility and live proof

### Recommended Public-Network Strategy

1. Deploy the smallest possible escrow contract surface.
2. Keep planner, broker, scoring, and dossier orchestration offchain.
3. Require human approval for all irreversible payout actions.
4. Use a single seeded poster and seeded worker operator for the demo.
5. Rehearse the exact seeded flow on testnet before any public-network payout demo.

### Demo Script

1. Poster verifies identity.
2. Poster funds one idea job.
3. Planner emits `BuildBrief`.
4. Worker verifies identity and claims one milestone.
5. Worker agent submits:
   - output artifact
   - trace
   - one paid dependency event
6. Scorer accepts.
7. Poster approves release.
8. Arc escrow releases payout.
9. 0G dossier link is opened.

### Demo Failure Fallbacks

#### Arc unavailable

- show local deterministic replay with the same escrow state transitions

#### World unavailable

- use clearly labeled preverified operator account for demo continuity

#### 0G unavailable

- show queued dossier state and local mirror, but mark storage as pending

### Mainnet Readiness Checklist

- contract addresses recorded
- public testnet contract addresses recorded
- funded poster account seeded
- funded payout account seeded
- worker operator account verified
- public dossier write tested
- acceptance and payout tested once before stage demo
- fallback mode rehearsed

### Public-Network Honesty Rules

1. Do not claim open marketplace liquidity if only one worker exists.
2. Do not claim autonomous payouts if approval remains human-gated.
3. Do not claim censorship-resistant dispute resolution if disputes remain offchain.
4. Clearly label any stubbed sponsor integration.
